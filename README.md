General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
No more than 5 functions per file
You are allowed to use the C standard library
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project

Stack:

Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) Structure: In a stack, the last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates where you add and remove plates from the top.
Operations: Stacks support two primary operations:
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
Common Use Cases: Stacks are used in scenarios where you need to keep track of function calls (call stack) or manage temporary data that needs to be processed in reverse order.
Queue:

First-In-First-Out (FIFO) Structure: In a queue, the first element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a line of people waiting for a bus, where the person who arrives first gets on the bus first.
Operations: Queues also support two primary operations:
Enqueue: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes and returns the front element of the queue.
Common Use Cases: Queues are used when you want to manage data in the order it was received or when you need to ensure that tasks are processed in a specific order, such as in task scheduling, print job management, or breadth-first search algorithms.
